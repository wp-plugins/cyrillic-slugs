Converts Cyrillic letters in post slugs to their Latin phonetic equivalent.

== Description ==

Since Permalinks that contain Cyrillic may cause problems on some server setups, this plugin will work around this problem by updating the automatic Post Slug generation code. In this way, posts which have a title in Cyrillic will have permalinks transliterated in Latin characters.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `cyr-slugs.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
